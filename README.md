# Candy Crash on React

I've build this game for practising logic in games using React. 
And also for my daughters (Amy and Leila) to see that sometimes I'm learning useful things too :)
So far you can play by reloading you browser, each time you reload, you get your score.
Functionality will be improved soon. So far you can play it in here:

p.S. I've used tutorials from Ania Kubow, thanks to her for her clear explanaitions.
