# Candy Crash on React

I made this game for practising logic in games using React. 
And also for my daughters (Amy and Leila) to see that sometimes I'm learning useful things too :)
So far you can play by reloading you browser, each time you reload, you get your score.
Functionality will be improved soon. So far you can play it in here:
